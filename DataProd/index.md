## Power vs Milleage.  
  
An important factor when choosing a vehicle is **power**. A low power car will often struggle
with high loads and difficult terrain. It can be said that power correlates with the *usefulness*
of a car.  

However, power is hardly free. **Mileage**, defined as *distance* (measured in miles) travelled per *unit of combustible*, 
is also widely considered as one of the most important topics when choosing a car as it 
correlates directly with the cost of use. Higher power often means higher energy consumption, 
which is quantified as lower Mileage.  

### But by how much can we *expect* power to impact fuel consumption?  
  
> Balancing power and mileage is of paramount importance when choosing and designing a vehicle.
* Higher power often means higher fuel consumption.
* We would like to quantify how is mileage expected to change in function of power.

## A Simple Mileage Prediction Algorithm.

In order to solve this question I propose as a first approximation to use a linear model fitting
a data set with the two variables.  

The data used is the *mtcars* data set found at the *datasets* packages of base
**R**. This data was "*extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel 
consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models)*".
The units used are **Miles per Gallon** and **HP (Horse Power)**.  

> We compute the model using a least squares approximation to the data by calling the following **R** script:
> 
> ```r
> modFit <- lm(mpg~hp, data = mtcars)
> ```

> And we show it's parameter with the following code:
> 
> ```r
> summary.lm(modFit)
> ```

## The Application.

The prediction uses a least squares linear model fitting the *mtcars* dataset. As the summary shows 
in the previous slide shows, the percentage of 
explained variation by this model is 60.2%, with a P-value close to 0.  

From the model we infer that we **expect a decrease on mileage of -0.068** per unit of power.
